# Supplement to "MACHINE LEARNING APPLICATIONS IN BIOLOGY"

In this GitHub repository, we summarize basic information that was used to collect data and plot results for Alam et al. (submitted). You will find original sections in LaTex for particular components of the main text (`.tex`, `.cls`, `.bib`), scripts for retrieving papers in accordance with queries (`.py`), code for subsetting the retrieved papers (`.R`), as well as code used to generate figures (`/figs`).
